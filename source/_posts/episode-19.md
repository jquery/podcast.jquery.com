## Interview

This week we talked with [Bear Bibeault](https://bibeault.ninja/) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110301141112/http://www.bibeault.org/resume/)) and [Yahuda Katz](https://yehudakatz.com/) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110414211153/http://yehudakatz.com/)), authors of the upcoming book "jQuery in Action: Second Edition". We discussed the intended audience of the book, how the chapters are laid out, the differences between the 1st and the 2nd editions, and much more.

[jQuery in Action: Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/jquery-in-action-second-edition) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110304222605/http://www.manning.com/bibeault2/))

We’ve arranged with Bear and Yehuda’s publisher, Manning Publications, to give our listeners 35% off any version of jQuery in Action, 2nd Edition (ebook or print book). Go to www.manning.com, put the book in your cart, and at checkout, enter the promotional code `jqpod` to redeem the offer. The code is good until June 1, 2010.

## Ralph’s Plugin of the week

The [jQuery UI Growl](http://web.archive.org/web/20100412010646/http://satsume.com/growl/) is a plugin that uses the jQuery UI Modal Widget to simulate the Mac Growl notification effect. This plugin takes advantage of the jQuery Theme Roller, so you can easily change the look and feel of the plugin.

Elijah mentioned that you may also want to take a look at the [Pines Notify jQuery Plugin](http://web.archive.org/web/20100409093356/http://pines.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/pines/pines/raw-file/tip/pnotify/index.html), which also has jQuery Theme Roller support. In addition you can always check out the classic [jGrowl jQuery Plugin](http://web.archive.org/web/20110411150651/http://www.stanlemon.net/projects/jgrowl.html).

## Elijah’s Tutorial of the week

We briefly covered the topic of the jQuery Templating Proposal a couple of weeks ago, but this past week a short screencast was posted on Nettuts+ by [Andrew Burgess](https://twitter.com/andrew8088) entitled [Quick Tip: An Introduction to jQuery Templating](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-an-introduction-to-jquery-templating--net-10535). In the short 5 minute screencast Andrew shows how to render the template, how to pass options, and how to reference the template index value. It is important to note that the content covered is currently only a proposal and the final Templating piece may be different from what is shown.
