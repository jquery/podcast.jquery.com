## Interview

We pick up right were we left off last week with our discussion with jQuery Developer Relations Team member [Karl Swedberg](https://karlswedberg.com/).   Karl runs the site LearningjQuery.com and we ask him what other resources are available for jQuery.  We also discuss the jQuery Conference in Boston next month as we are all giving talks.
