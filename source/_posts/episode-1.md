## Question from Listeners

**Paul Irish** – What can the jQuery community do to help push out the jQuery 1.4 release? I know there’s a lot to do with the release notes and such, but what can the average jQuery community member do to help?

**Ernie Bello** – Just curious what the process is for deciding what goes in or what comes out from the API?
