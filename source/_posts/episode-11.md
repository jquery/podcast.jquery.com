## Plugin of the week

Ralph picks the [Quicksand jQuery Plugin](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104022958/http://razorjack.net/quicksand/) devloped by Jacek Galanciak as this weeks plugin of the week. Quicksand allows you to reorder and filter items with a nice shuffling animation.

Quicksand uses Easing effects and you can use the [Easing plugins from jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/).

“Transition” music, [“Whip It” by Devo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbt30UnzRWw) – the Devo hat was the inspiration for the original jQuery Logo and is still represented in our current identity.

## Tutorial of the week

Elijah picks a couple of Tutorials the first being David Walsh’s “[Fancy FAQs with jQuery Sliders](http://davidwalsh.name/jquery-sliders).” A simple technique for creating a collapsible FAQ page. The second tutorial is from Scott Guthrie and his [blog post about the jQuery 1.4.1 VSDOC](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/02/08/jquery-1-4-1-intellisense-with-visual-studio.aspx) file now available. If you want instructions on how to use the VSDOC you can read the [tutorial on Learning jQuery](http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/07/setting-up-visual-studio-intellisense-for-jquery). You can download the file for Visual Studio on the [jQuery download page](http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery) and look for [Visual Studio](http://web.archive.org/web/20120102094813im_/http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.4.1-vsdoc.js) link under 1.4.1.
