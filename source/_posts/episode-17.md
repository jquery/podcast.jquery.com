## Interview

We had the chance to sit down with the jQuery UI team last week, right before they launched jQuery UI 1.8 final. We talked with them about the updated Widget Factory framework, new widgets, Autocomplete and Button. We also talk about the new utility plugin called Position and the new fade effect.

The Infrastructure team gives an update on the ThemeRoller and Download builder. And we wrap up with a look at the teams plan ahead.

This episode was recorded a week ealier then when it was released so some things that are mentioned already happened, like the planning weekend in Boston and the move to Github. Also, Doug Neiner filled in for Elijah as he was flying back from MIX 10.
