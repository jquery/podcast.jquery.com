Fresh off the jQuery Conference 2010: Boston, we sit down with Ben Nadel and talk about the conference.  Ben tells us about what he learned and tells us about the awesome photo he got with the jQuery Community.  Ben’s a jQuery spokesperson for the Cold Fusion community and we talk about that as well.

Host: Ralph Whitbeck &amp; Rey Bango.
