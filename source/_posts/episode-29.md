## Interview

Rey and Ralph are joined again by Elijah Manor and Doug Neiner and this week we talk about the new JavaScript Tutorial site, Script Junkie. Rey is the editor of the site and both Elijah and Doug have written articles regarding jQuery and jQuery UI for the site.

We also review what is the top priority for the jQuery team right now and that is **Mobile jQuery**. Ralph gets you up to speed by outlining the problem scope, the research that the team is finding and lay out the current jQuery strategy for mobile.
