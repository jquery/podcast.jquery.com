This week we talked with Jeffrey Way. He is the editor of Nettuts+, and the Site Manager of ThemeForest and CodeCanyon. Jeffrey gives an overview of the Nettuts+ website and explains why their tutorials focus so much on jQuery and gives some examples of recent jQuery related articles.

We also announce the winner of the [Nettuts giveaway](http://web.archive.org/web/20120315234900/http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/free-ticket-to-the-jquery-conference-in-san-francisco/) for a free jQuery Conference Bay Area ticket. And that wasn’t the only thing we gave away this week either!
