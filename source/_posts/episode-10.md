## Plugin of the week

This week Ralph picked the [GMap plugin](http://web.archive.org/web/20101114154347/http://gmap.nurtext.de/) developed by Cedric Kastner. A jQuery plugin that makes working with the Google Maps API easy. This plugin will be very handy by making it easy to plugin in coordinates that will be available with the geolocation services that are going to be apart HTML 5 spec.

## Tutorial of the week

This week Elijah picked a tutorial from NETTUS called [How to Test your JavaScript Code with QUnit](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/how-to-test-your-javascript-code-with-qunit/). From the tutorial, “QUnit, developed by the jQuery team, is a great framework for unit testing your JavaScript. In this tutorial, I’ll introduce what QUnit specifically is, and why you should care about rigorously testing your code.” <http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit>, <https://github.com/jquery/qunit>.

We also mention TestSwarm a distributed JavaScript testing service. [testswarm.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20100924221413/http://testswarm.com/), <https://github.com/jquery/testswarm>.

Finally, Ralph brings attention to the backwards incompatiability of jQuery 1.4 “jQuery() (with no arguments) no longer converts to jQuery(document).” Read more at <http://api.jquery.com/jquery>.

Congratulations to the new jQuery Team Members:

* Paul Irish - Developer Relations Team
