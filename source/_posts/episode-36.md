We sit down with Boaz Sender and Ben Alman who both work for Bocoup in Boston, MA.  We discuss Bocoup from their clients to their open source contributions.  Bocoup is providing the pre-conference training in Boston and we talk about the training class and the advance classes that are also offered.  Bocoup Loft also hosts many events including jQuery Meetups in Boston.

Host: Ralph Whitbeck &amp; Rey Bango.
