## Interview

This week we take a look at the RewardJS project that Richard D. Worth has put together. RewardJS is a campaign to reward developers that fix bugs in a open source project with daily, weekly and a monthly prize for the most bugs fixed. The content is already a week and a half old but there is still plenty of time to jump in and win a prize. Prizes already have included, XBox 360, Wii, iPad 2, Apple MacBook Air and many more. This month the campaign is targeting jQuery UI bugs.
