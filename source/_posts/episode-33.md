## Interview

jQuery Developer Relations team member, [Karl Swedberg](https://karlswedberg.com/), joins us this week.  Karl is the author of Learning jQuery 1.3, jQuery Reference Guide 1.4 and technical reviewer of the jQuery Cookbook.  He also runs LearningjQuery.com where he just released JSONP for the API site.  In this episode, we talk about Karl, the needs of the jQuery community and what Karl’s learned since the launch of api.jquery.com, as he manages that site day-to-day.  This is the first of two episodes with Karl.  Next episode will appear next week.
