## Plugin of the week

[jQuery UI Milestone release – Tooltip](https://blog.jqueryui.com/2010/05/jquery-ui-19m1-tooltip/)

Tooltip is a new widget that came out of the jQuery UI Planning Wiki. It is a jQuery Ui plugin built on top of the Widget Factory and utilized the new position utility plugin from jQuery UI 1.8

All you need is an element with a title attribute. Grab that element and call .tooltip() on it.

Example tooltip to play with: http://jsbin.com/abego
