## Interview

This week Elijah and Ralph sit down and talk with Microsoft’s Phil Haack, Senior Program Manager on the ASP.NET team, currently working on the new ASP.NET MVC Framework. We discuss their recent decisions to include jQuery into several of their products what ASP.NET MVC is and how jQuery is integrated into the project.

* Who is Phil Haack?
  * Senior Program Manager at Microsoft
  * Oversees the [ASP.NET MVC project](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/mvc) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110402001421/http://www.asp.net/mvc))
  * Lead Developer of the Open Source [Subtext Blogging Engine](http://web.archive.org/web/20110902022437/http://www.subtextproject.com/default.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1)
* ASP.NET MVC
  * Back in September 2008, Microsoft chose to include jQuery into the ASP.NET MVC template. This was the first time that Microsoft included any open source project alongside of their product.
  * Unlike ASP.NET WebForms, which more developers might have experience, ASP.NET MVC doesn’t inject a bunch of dynamically generated attributes and client-side script. Therefore, integration with jQuery is a very good fit and is similar to what it might be in other languages such as PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc…
  * ASP.NET MVC also incorporates Jörn Zaefferer’s [jQuery Validation Plugin](https://jqueryvalidation.org/) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824050938/http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation)) as part of their client-side validation strategy (based off of Steven Sanderson’s [xVal project](http://web.archive.org/web/20110824235828/http://xval.codeplex.com/)) in their [MVC Futures project](http://web.archive.org/web/20110822043149/http://aspnet.codeplex.com/).
  * The default client-side validation uses MS AJAX, but you can easily swap out these two validation frameworks. You can find an example of how to swap between the two on Phil’s blog [ASP.NET MVC 2 Custom Validation](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/11/19/aspnetmvc2-custom-validation.aspx/).
* Microsoft provides support for jQuery
  * If someone has a license for Visual Studio, a MSDN subscription, etc.. they can create a support ticket and someone from the Customer Support team at Microsoft will assist you in solving your jQuery issue.
* Phil has recently created some jQuery Plugins of his own
  * [Live Preview Plugin](https://haacked.com/archive/2009/12/15/live-preview-jquery-plugin.aspx/)
  * [jQuery.Undoable Plugin](https://haacked.com/archive/2010/01/01/jquery-undoable-plugin.aspx/) ([archived](http://web.archive.org/web/20110902045208/http://haacked.com/archive/2010/01/01/jquery-undoable-plugin.aspx))
