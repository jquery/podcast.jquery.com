## Interview

In our final part with Remy Sharp we talk about his jQuery for Designers site. jQuery for Designers is a tutorial and screencast site which caters to designers and how to use jQuery to add interactive elements to your site. We discuss the difference between a developer and designer and the needs each has. Remy is the organizer of the Full Frontal JavaScript Conference in Brighton, England.  Plans are underway to have another conference again this November. Finally, we talk about Snap Bird a site which searches farther back in your twitter timeline then the Twitter API will provide you.
