In addition, Elijah also recommends Ralph’s recent [jQuery 1.4 Gives Us a New Way to Zebra Stripe](http://web.archive.org/web/20100302154739/http://ralphwhitbeck.com/2010/01/22/jQuery14GiveUsANewWayToZebraStripe.aspx) blog post.

Even though this example isn’t the most efficient way to do zebra striping, it is a good example that demonstrates the new setter function that is now available in many methods in jQuery.
